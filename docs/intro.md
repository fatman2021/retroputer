# Retroputer

Retroputer is an emulator for a computer system that resembles machines in the 80's and 90's. However, the machine as presented did not exist in this form -- rather, the emulator seeks only to emulate the look and feel of these machines, not replicate an actual machine from the era. There are plenty of emulators that do so excellently. Instead, Retroputer has these goals:

* Be simple to learn

* Encourage programming

* Work in a web browser

* Resemble 8 and 16-bit machines

* Have a completely understandable architecture from low-level "hardware" to high-level software
