# Trap Reference

The 6516 CPU is capable of generating and responding to 256 traps or interrupts. Some of these traps are generated by external events, while others are generated by software.

All traps except RESET \(0x00\) can be suppressed by clearing the Interrupt Enable \(**I**\) flag. This can be important when writing non-reentrant trap handlers than cannot be interrupted.

| Trap Name | Trap Number | Software/Hardware | Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FRAME | 0xF0 | Hardware | A frame has been displayed | Occurs sixty times a second and should complete quickly. A long-running FRAME handler will slow the rest of the machine down. |
| SECOND | 0xF1 | Hardware | A second has passed | Occurs each second |
| MINUTE | 0xF2 | Hardware | A minute has passed | Occurs each minute |
| HOUR | 0xF3 | Hardware | An hour has passed | Occurs each hour |
| RESET | 0x00 | Hardware | Reset button pressed | Performs steps necessary to initialize memory, the screen, and other subsystems needed in order to boot the machine. |
