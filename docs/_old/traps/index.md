# Trap Reference

The 6516 CPU is capable of generating and responding to 256 traps or interrupts. Some of these traps are generated by external events, while others are generated by software.

All traps except RESET \(0x00\) can be suppressed by clearing the Interrupt Enable \(**I**\) flag. This can be important when writing non-reentrant trap handlers than cannot be interrupted.

| Trap Name |   #  | Class    | Event                      | Description |
| :-------- | :--- | :------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| KEYDOWN   | 0x10 | Device   | A key has been pressed     | Occurs whenever a normal key is pressed |
| KEYUP     | 0x11 | Device   | A key has been released    | Occurs whenever any key is released |
| TIMER-0   | 0x80 | Device   | Timer 0 has been triggered | Occurs whenever timer zero reaches or exceeds zero |
| TIMER-1   | 0x81 | Device   | Timer 1 has been triggered | Occurs whenever timer one reaches or exceeds zero |
| TIMER-2   | 0x82 | Device   | Timer 2 has been triggered | Occurs whenever timer two reaches or exceeds zero |
| TIMER-3   | 0x83 | Device   | Timer 3 has been triggered | Occurs whenever timer three reaches or exceeds zero |
| TIMER-4   | 0x84 | Device   | Timer 4 has been triggered | Occurs whenever timer four reaches or exceeds zero |
| FRAME     | 0xF0 | Hardware | A frame has been displayed | Occurs sixty times a second and should complete quickly. A long-running FRAME handler will slow the rest of the machine down. |
| RESET     | 0x00 | Hardware | Reset button pressed | Performs steps necessary to initialize memory, the screen, and other subsystems needed in order to boot the machine. |
